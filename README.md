What is it?

MinerX is an automated MiningTool for newbies. Its Java based (Yes you need Java to use it) and its combinated with CCminer.

This MiningTool does only support Desktop GPUs, so no mobile GPUs are supported. ( Right now only NVIDIA GPUs are supported )

The only thing you need to put in is your TrezarCoinAddress, wait until it fetches your card and click StartMining.

How to use it:

Download the MinerX from below and execute the .jar.

Source: https://github.com/trezarcoin/minerx

Files: (Both - .jar and the .tar.gz)

If you only download the .jar you need to put it next to your CCminer folder which should be named “CCminer”.

NOTE: TZC-MinerX-Alpha needs to be located in a local HOME folder & next to the “CCminer” Folder, otherwise MinerX may not be able to fetch Grafikcard information.
